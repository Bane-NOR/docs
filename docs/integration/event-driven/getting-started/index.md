# Getting Started - Event Driven

!!! warning "Work In Progress"
    Getting Started is a work in progress, where internal development is in focus

Welcome to the getting started with event driven architecture at Bane NOR. This will be split up into sections depending on the role and audience whom want to start.

=== "Developer"
    Since the event driven capabilities are not yet ready for services that want to do event driven integrations we have worked out some information on how `technical dept` can be minimized and migrations will be easier by using `Azure Event Hub`.
