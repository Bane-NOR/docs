## Why a dedicated Integration Team?
The overall ICT strategy for Bane NOR is to become a digital and data-driven company which demands new ways of working. Through service-oriented focus and making use of data as a strategic resource Bane NOR will improve the technical possibilities within the value chain. Some goals set for ICT:

- Enable event-based information to empower sharing 
- Become more value- and customer oriented 
- Improve application portfolio and reduce operational cost  
- Strengthen innovation power

Based on [Gartners Integration Maturity Model](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3414117), we assessed and set plans for our integration delivery, integration strategy, integration platform and engagement model. As a result, we established a dedicated integration team working with objectives and key-results supporting Bane NOR with integration capabilities. We will establish reusable integration artifacts, focus on providing self-service for developers, provide guidelines and best practices, and increase the integration competency within Bane NOR.
