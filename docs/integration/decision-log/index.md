# Decision Log

Decision taken by the platform teams.

## Naming and Formatting

Decision Logs are requested to follow RFC (request for comments) naming standard. Specifically, authors should name their documents with a sequentially increasing integer (or serial number) and then the topic: (sequence number - topic). Example: 0001-SeparateConfigurationInterface. The sequence is a global sequence for all decisions. Per RFC and Michael Nygard suggestions the makeup of the ADR document should generally include:

- Title
- Status (proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.)
- Context and Proposed Design
- Decision
- Consequences/considerations
- References
- Document history is maintained via GIT history.
